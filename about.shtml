        <p>Gallop Racing LLC is a private company based in New York (USA). Our mission is <i>Horse Racing for Everyone, Everywhere</i>. The company is currently experimenting with two "traditional" fantasy-style contests for the sport of thoroughbred horse racing. These are "season" long contests that consist of drafts and weekly scoring events.</p>

        <p>Anyone can register for a stable and play along in the contest for fun. There is a global Leaderboard where stables would be listed. There is also an option to create your private Leaderboard where you would compete amongst family and friends.</p>
        
        <p>There is no cost to register a stable, and there are no prizes to be paid out by Gallop Racing. We are merely facilitating the game in the hopes that it could create a broader audience of fans for horse racing. We hope by creating a contest in which casual racing fans can enjoy the sport with their family and friends, more people can experience how truly exciting a horse race can be!</p>
