      <p><i>Last Updated: May 26, 2022</i></p>

      <p>All data throughout Gallop is currently sourced from Equibase. The data can be found within the "Horses" sheet, which can be accessed via a button on each contest page.</p>

      <p><img src="/images/horses-button.png" style="max-height: 360px; max-width: 441px; border: none;"/></p>

      <p>The data from the "Horses" sheet will then trickle down into the individual "Stable Entry" sheets.</p>

      <p><img src="/images/stable-entry-sheet-data-headings1.png" style="max-height: 46px; max-width: 670px; border:none"/><br/>
        <img src="/images/stable-entry-sheet-data-headings2.png" style="max-height: 44px; max-width: 597px; border:none"/>
      </p>

      <p>The Equibase data are sourced manually, and will be current as of the horse's last <b>Graded Stakes</b> entry on a <b>United States Dirt Track</b> (in most cases).</p>

      <p><i>What does this mean exactly?</i></p>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Trainer changes may not be current, depending on when the change took place. In other words, the horse has <i>not</i> entered into a US Dirt Graded Stakes race since the trainer change took effect.</li>
          <li>Horses may have ran in non-Graded Stakes races since the last race listed on the sheet. For example:
              <ul>
              <li>An Allowance Race</li>
              <li>A Listed or "Black-Type" stakes race (non-graded)</li>
              <li>An international race</li>
              <li>A turf race</li>
              <li>A synthetic or "all-weather" track race</li>
              <li>Any other type of race that is not US Dirt Graded Stakes</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Races like those mentioned above may not be reflected in Gallop.</li>
          <li>The "Trainer Count" column in the "Horses" sheet is just for estimation purposes. <i>It will never reflect the exact number of horses in any trainer's stable at any given time.</i></li>
          <li>The list of horses may also include some Turf and International horses. So players should not assume that every horse on that list will run in a Gallop contest race, such as RTTR or RTTBC.</li>
          <li>It is also possible that some horses on that list may be retired, deceased, or no longer in training.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p><b>So long story short, it is important that contest players also do their own due diligence to make sure that any horses they are interested in are still in training. You should also confirm who their most recent connections are, since that information might not be current within Gallop.</b></p>

      <p>As Gallop moves beyond the Development/BETA stage, there should be more data automation introduced. This Data Disclaimer will updated accordingly as that happens.</p>
