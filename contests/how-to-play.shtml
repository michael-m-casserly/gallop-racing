      <p>Gallop currently offers two separate contests. One is the "Road to the Roses", or RTTR, and the other is the
        "Road to the Breeders' Cup", or RTTBC.</p>
      <p>RTTR runs from January into May, and RTTBC runs from June into November. Players can participate in
        either/or/both of the contests. One contest doesn't have any dependency on the other.</p>
      <p>These contests function like <i>traditional</i> fantasy sports (as opposed to <i>daily</i> fantasy sports). The
        focus here is on a season-long contest, with weekly scoring events. These type of contests tend to work best
        when you can participate amongst family and friends and compete against each other.</p>
      <p>Specific details on each contest can be found below, along with some details that apply to all contests.</p>

              <h4>Kentucky Derby</h4>

              <p>The scope of the RTTR contest will be all of the <a
                  href="https://www.kentuckyderby.com/horses/prep-races" target="_blank">Kentucky Derby Prep Races</a>
                (America circuit) beginning after the 1st week in January. This amounts to ~25 races.</p>

              <p>In mid-January you'll draft <b>5 horses, 2 trainers, and 2 jockeys</b> whom you think have a good
                chance at winning the Kentucky Derby.</p>

              <p>There will be 7 races from late January thru mid-February where you can earn points.</p>

              <p>The 2nd draft of <b>5 horses</b> will take place in mid-February.</p>

              <p>There will be 10 races following that draft up until the end of March.</p>

              <p>The draft at the end of March is a variable draft, meaning you can take anywhere from <b>0-5
                  horses</b>.</p>

              <p>There will be 7 races following that draft leading up to the Derby.</p>

              <p>The week of the Derby, you can use any of those <b>0-5 horse</b> selections that you didn't use at the
                end of March to complete your stable.</p>

              <p>Come Derby Day, you'll end up with <b>15 horses, 2 trainers and 2 jockeys</b> in your stable.</p>

              <p>Horse points are awarded for the Top 4 finishers in each race. Trainer and Jockey points are only
                awarded to the Winner.</p>

        <h4>All Contests</h4>
      </center>
      <p>Stables can have the same horses, trainers and jockeys as other player's stables. The opportunity to separate
        comes with the "Power Horses" you select each week. Those horses will earn you 2x points.</p>

      <p>All horses, trainers, jockeys and sires (RTTBC only) in your stable are eligible to score points every week.
        There is no "starting" or "sitting/benching" of entries in your stable.</p>

      <p>As the contest goes on, the races are worth more points. So even if you stumble out of the gate, you can make
        up a lot of ground down the stretch!</p>
