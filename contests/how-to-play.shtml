      <p>Gallop currently offers two separate contests. One is the <i>Road to the Roses</i>, or "RTTR" the other is the
        <i>Road to the Breeders' Cup</i> or "RTTBC".</p>

      <p>RTTR runs from January into May, and RTTBC runs from June into November. Players can participate in
        either/or/both of the contests. One contest doesn't have any dependency on the other.</p>

      <p>These contests function like <i>traditional</i> fantasy sports (as opposed to <i>daily</i> fantasy sports). The
        focus here is on a season-long competition with weekly scoring events. These contests work best
        when you can participate and compete amongst family and friends.</p>

      <p>Please find specific details on each contest below.</p>

        <h4>All Contests</h4>
      </div>
      
      <p>Stables can have the same horses, trainers, and jockeys as other players' stables. The opportunity to separate comes with the "Power Picks" you select each week. Those horses will earn you 2x points.</p>

      <p>All horses, trainers, jockeys, and sires (RTTBC only) in your stable are eligible to score points every week. There is no "starting" or "sitting/benching" of entries in your stable.</p>

      <p>Race "Nominations" are typically published two weeks before a race. Nominations contain a list of horses eligible to enter a race (pending any "late" nominees). Race "Entries" are then published the week of the race, typically no less than three days before the race. Both Nominations and Entries will be made available on the contest page. You may also go directly to <a href="https://www.equibase.com" target="_blank">Equibase.com</a> to find these.</p>

      <p>All additonal drafting periods are planned around the Nominations schedule to ensure that participants have as much advanced access as possible to potential runners in a future race.</p>


      <p>As the contest goes on, the races are worth more points. So even if you stumble out of the gate, you can make up a lot of ground down the stretch!</p>
