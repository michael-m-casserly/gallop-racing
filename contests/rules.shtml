                      horses that finish in a DH will be awarded the total applicable points for that Win, Place or Show
                      position. We will follow exactly what the official Kentucky Derby OR Breeders Cup Points System
                      awards to each horse as the base value, and then that would be multiplied if a Power Horse is
                      selected. On Kentucky Derby OR Breeder's Cup Weekend (when RTKD or BC Points no longer apply), in
                      the case of a DH, both horses will be awarded full points for that position, and the next runner
                      would be placed according to that. For example, if there is a 2-horse DH for the Win, then the 2
                      horses that finish in 1st will be awarded full Win points, there will be no Place points awarded,
                      and the horse that finishes behind the 2 horses in the DH would be awarded Show points. Same logic
                      applies if there are DH for Place and/or Show Positions as well. In the rare event that there are
                      more than 3 horses involved in a DH, then every horse would be awarded full points for their
                      position, and there would be no points awarded for any of the subsequent positions. Same goes for
                      Winning Sire/Trainer/Jockey, each one would be awarded full points for any Win. Lastly, in case of
                      any discrepancy or confusion, we will ultimately follow whatever the Road to the Kentucky Derby OR
                      Breeders' Cup points process awards the horses, since we are following those points systems.</td>
