        <h4>Variable Drafting</h4>

        <p>The final 2 Supplemental Drafts in the RTTR contest will be "variable". Meaning stables can select anywhere between 0 and 5 horses to add to their stable, over 2 separate selection periods.</p>

        <p>The first period will be the first week of April. The second period will be the week leading into the Kentucky Derby.</p>

        <p>While there are many unique factors for each stable to consider when making their selections, in the end it amounts to a balancing act and weighing the pros and cons.</p>

        <p>Here are some high-level pros and cons to each approach:</p>

        <p><b><i>Drafting a horse the first week of April (with 7 races left):</i></b></p>
        <p><b>PRO:</b> The horse has an opportunity to earn points in those 7 races leading into the Derby.</p>
        <p><b>CON:</b> The horse misses the board in that race, earns no points, and doesn't make it into the Derby.</p>

        <p><b><i>Waiting to draft a horse during Derby week:</i></b></p>
        <p><b>PRO:</b> You know for certain that the horse will be entered into the Derby.</p>
        <p><b>CON:</b> You miss out on any opportunity to earn points in those 7 races prior.</p>

        <p>RTTR Points in the Kentucky Derby itself are worth a lot more, so there is definitely some thoughtful consideration required by each stable on their best combination!</p>
