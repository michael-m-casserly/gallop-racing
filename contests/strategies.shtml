        <center><h4>Variable Drafting (RTTR Only)</h4></center>

        <p>The final 2 Supplemental Drafts in the RTTR contest will be "variable". Meaning stables can select anywhere between 0 and 5 horses to add to their stable, over 2 separate selection periods.</p>

        <p>The first period will be the week of late March / early April. The second period will be the week leading into the Kentucky Derby.</p>

        <p>While there are many unique factors for each stable to consider when making their selections, in the end it amounts to a balancing act and weighing the pros and cons.</p>

        <p>Here are some high-level pros and cons to each approach:</p>

        <p><b><i>Drafting a horse in late March / early April (with 7 races left):</i></b></p>
        <p><b>PRO:</b> The horse has an opportunity to earn points in those 7 races leading into the Kentucky Derby.</p>
        <p><b>CON:</b> The horse misses the board in that race, earns no points, and doesn't make it into the Kentucky Derby.</p>

        <p><b><i>Waiting to draft a horse during Kentucky Derby week:</i></b></p>
        <p><b>PRO:</b> You know for certain that the horse will be entered into the Kentucky Derby.</p>
        <p><b>CON:</b> You miss out on any opportunity to earn points in those 7 races prior.</p>

        <p>RTTR Points in the Kentucky Derby itself are worth a lot more, so there is definitely some thoughtful consideration required by each stable on their best combination. The most common is 3 then 2, or 4 then 1, or all 5 up front. Rarely are 4 or 5 left until Derby Week. But it all depends on each stable, their current position, stable strength, etc. This is where the RTTR Contest gets interesting!</p>

        <center><h4>Road to the Breeder's Cup Contest (RTTBC)</h4></center>

        <p>The RTTBC contest is a lot longer and encompasses more divisions than the RTTR contest (which is restricted to 3-year-old horses on the dirt). The RTTBC contest covers all 7 dirt divisions leading into the Breeders' Cup. The 7 divisions include:
          <ul>
            <li>Classic (<i>3YO and Up, longer distance</i>)</li>
            <li>Distaff (<i>3YO and Up, FEMALE, longer distance</i>)</li>
            <li>Dirt Mile (<i>3YO and Up, middle distance</i>)</li>
            <li>Sprint (<i>3YO and Up, short distance</i>)</li>
            <li>Filly & Mare Sprint (<i>3YO and Up, FEMALE, short distance</i>)</li>
            <li>Juveline (<i>2 Year-Olds</i>)</li>
            <li>Juveline Fillies (<i>2 Year-Olds, FEMALE</i>)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Since the RTTBC Contest covers over 100 graded stakes races, it would be impossible to draft a runner for every race.</p>

        <p>The most common approach is to draft runners for the Grade 1 races. The logic being, these are the horses most likely to move onto the Breeders' Cup. In addition, if they happen to lose a Grade 1 race, then they are very likely to come back and run in a lesser Grade 2 or Grade 3 race. Whereas if a horse were to lose a Grade 3 race, it would be unlikely to see them move onto the higher level Grade 2 and Grade 1 races.</p>
