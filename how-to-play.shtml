        <p>In mid-January you'll draft <b>5 horses, 2 trainers, and 2 jockeys</b> whom you think have a good chance at winning the Kentucky Derby.</p>

        <p>There will be 7 races from Jan 22nd thru Feb 12th where you can earn points.</p>
        
        <p>Then the 2nd draft of <b>5 horses</b> will take place in mid-February.</p>
        
        <p>There will be 10 races following that draft up until the next draft at the end of March.</p>
        
        <p>The draft at the end of March is a variable draft, meaning you can take anywhere from <b>0-5 horses</b>.</p>
        
        <p>There will be 7 races following that draft leading up to the Derby.</p>
        
        <p>The week of the Derby, you can use any of those <b>0-5 horse</b> selections that you didn't use at the end of March to complete your stable.</p>
        
        <p>Come Derby Day, you'll end up with <b>15 horses, 2 trainers and 2 jockeys</b> in your stable.</p>
        
        <p>Stables can have the same horses, trainers and jockeys as other player's stables. The opportunity to separate comes with the 3 "Power Horses" you select each week. Those horses will earn you 2x points.</p>

        <p>All horses, trainers, and jockeys in your stable are eligible to score points every week. There is no "starting" or "sitting/benching" of entries in your stable.</p>
        
        <p>As the contest goes on, the races are worth more points. So even if you stumble out of the gate, you can make up a lot of ground down the stretch!</p>
