Please be aware of the risk that any of his contending horses could potentially be moved to another trainer prior to the Kentucky Derby, if his current 3-year suspension at Churchill Downs is still in effect come May.<br><br>
      Also be aware that all horses currently trained by Bob Baffert will not be listed on the <a href="https://www.kentuckyderby.com/horses" target="_blank"  onclick="captureOutboundLink('https://www.kentuckyderby.com/horses');">Official Road to the Kentucky Derby Points Leaderboard</a>, as they are not eligible for those points. So if you are drafting solely off of that list, you could be missing some of the contenders.</td>
